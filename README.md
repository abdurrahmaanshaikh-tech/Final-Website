100% my code is from the lectures, however in some places i did do some trial and error to make sure its appropriate for my website. none of the code is from an outside source. 
all of the comments for the html code is in index.html only.

i used gradient and linear gradient in the body, wrapper and right-column.
  background: -o-linear-gradient(to top, blue 20%,#E6BBAD 80%); 


for tablets i used minimum 481 pixels to max 959 pixels, for phone i used max 480 pixels and for desktop/laptop i used 960 pixels or greater. 
i used these dimension because it is what was mentioned in the lecture.
